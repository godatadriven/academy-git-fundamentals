# Initializing and Cloning Git Repositories

Git is a widely-used distributed version control system that helps developers manage and collaborate on code. It keeps track of changes made to a codebase, allowing you to easily revert to previous versions or collaborate with other developers.

## Initializing a New Git Repository

To create a new Git repository, navigate to your project directory in the command line and run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory, creating a hidden `.git` folder to store metadata and version history.

## Cloning an Existing Git Repository

If you want to work on an existing Git repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone <repository-url>`

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the remote repository you want to clone. This command creates a local copy of the remote repository, allowing you to work on the project and sync your changes with the remote repository.
