# Hard vs soft resets in git

The difference between `git reset --soft` and `git reset --hard` lies in how they affect your working directory, the staging area, and the commit history.

### `git reset --soft`
- **Commit History**: The branch pointer is moved back to the specified commit, but the changes from the later commits remain in the **staging area**.
- **Staging Area**: Changes from the commits that are "undone" stay **staged**.
- **Working Directory**: No changes are made to the files in your working directory.
  
  **Use case**: When you want to undo a commit but keep the changes staged for another commit or review.

  **Example**:
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD^
  ```

### `git reset --hard`
- **Commit History**: The branch pointer is moved back to the specified commit, just like with `--soft`.
- **Staging Area**: The staging area is reset to match the specified commit. All changes staged for commit are **lost**.
- **Working Directory**: The working directory is also reset to match the specified commit. Any **uncommitted changes are permanently deleted**.

  **Use case**: When you want to completely discard any changes and commits, resetting both the commit history and your local changes.

  **Example**:
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD^
  ```

### Summary:
- **`--soft`**: Keeps your changes in the staging area. Good for undoing commits but keeping the changes.
- **`--hard`**: Completely discards all uncommitted changes. Good for when you want to wipe out any uncommitted work.
