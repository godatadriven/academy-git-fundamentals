## Getting started 🧑‍💻

There are two options for you to get started with the material.

1. Using Code Spaces

2. Using your own machine

### Using Code Spaces ☁️

In the Github repository, click on the green button `Code` and select `Open with Code Spaces`. This will open a new browser tab with a Code Space. You can now start working in the terminal.
